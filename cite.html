      <div class="panel">
        <dl>
          <dt>Burger menu and page layout overhaul with @media query</dt>
            <dd>A @media query with a breakpoint at 768px was used to change the page layout from a side navigation menu to a burger menu at the top. The breakpoint of 768px was chosen because this is a common breakpoint between small laptop screens and phones or tablets. To improve navigation at smaller screens, the logo also changes to a narrower version of the logo to prevent too much space being taken up at the top of the screen. JavaScript was used to toggle the burger menu open and closed.</dd>
          <dt>CSS Grid rearrangement with @media query</dt>
            <dd>For the Shop and Account pages, responsive design was implemented by simply changing the grid-template-areas or grid-template-columns to a more narrow mobile layout. This fixes the layout without requiring too many extra lines of code.</dd>
          <dt>Element resizing with and without @media query</dt>
            <dd>Images are allowed to size down (except for logo images) throughout the website by just setting a max height. This combined with native CSS Grid for other elements maintained good responsiveness of the webpage for the range of screen sizes above or below the media query breakpoint. The submenu in the Shop page was explicitly sized down by reducing margins and paddings with the media query breakpoint.</dd>

      <div class="panel">
        <dl>
          <dt>Back to top button</dt>
            <dd>In the Shop page, a "Back to Top" button appears when the user begins scrolling down. This was implemented using window.onscroll event to trigger a function that displays the button if the user scrolls 20px or more down the page.</dd>
          <dt>Pop up alerts to simulate functionality</dt>
            <dd>In the Shop page, clicking on any "Add to cart" button triggers a pop up alert confirming that the item has been added to the user's cart. This was implemented with a JavaScript function with onclick event. In the Account page, clicking on "Log out" or "Re-order" also triggers a confirmation message.</dd>
          <dt>Sub-menu to skip to a subsection of the page</dt>
            <dd>Native HTML. In the Shop page, the user can skip directly to a section of the catalogue using a sub-menu at the top of the page.</dd>
          <dt>Accordions</dt>
            <dd>Contact us and Cite (this) page have accordions implemented using JavaScript to show or hide sections.</dd>
          <dt>Profile picture change</dt>
            <dd>In the Account page, user can select a different profile picture from a drop down menu. The profile picture instantly updates upon a selection (as a form of "preview").</dd>
          <dt>JavaScript to check/confirm changes</dt>
            <dd>In the Account page, clicking the "Save" button on either the subscription or the profile picture section will trigger a function that checks if something has actually been selected. If it has, it displays a confirmation that changes were saved, but if nothing is selected then it prompts the user to pick something.</dd>

      <div class="panel">
        <dl>
          <dt>Contact us page - Get a free quote form</dt>
            <dd>This form has many fields and simulates a customer requesting a quote for a large order or catering to an event. Fields are organized in fieldsets, and include basic customer information such as name, email, and phone number; order details with checkboxes, drop down selection, and text area; and a pick up and payment section with radio buttons, and date and time selectors. Native CSS validation was used for the email, phone, and date and time fields. Some forms were also marked as "required" using CSS, which does not allow the user to submit without filling them in. The form echoes back the inputs using the modified PHP program from Assignment 7.</dd>
          <dt>Account page - Manage your subscriptions form</dt>
            <dd>This form has only two radio buttons, however it also echoes the response using the modified PHP program. Furthermore, this form is using JavaScript to validate whether a selection was made when the "Save" button is clicked.</dd>
